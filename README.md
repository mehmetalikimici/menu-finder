# Menu-Finder

I created menu-finder. In the design, I implemented the dynamics with JavaScript along with CSS and Bootstrap.<br>

As seen in the design, I created a responsive menu that can transform according to different screen sizes with content in different categories. 
I converted the contents into a file in JSON format and then imported it into a JavaScript file. 
Then, I completed the menu by separating the products according to their categories.
